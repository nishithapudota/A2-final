<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: Our product listing was the best part of our website we clearly gave the description price and provided the image of the product.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Minuses:During the usability testing we got feed backs like we should have used the search facility. </strong> </p>
<p><strong>Interesting: There is no that intreseting feature in our website we just met all the main expections and gave a lot of time for css and tried to get the best output especially the colour combinations.</strong></p>
